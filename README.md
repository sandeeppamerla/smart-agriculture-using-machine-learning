Agriculture is a major contributor to the Indian economy. The common problem existing among the Indian farmers are they don’t choose the right crop based on their soil requirements. Due to this they face a serious setback in productivity. This problem of the farmers has been addressed through precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that uses research data of soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data collection and suggests the farmers the right crop
based on their site-specific parameters. This reduces the wrong choice on a crop and increases the productivity.

In this we are building an intelligent system, which intends to assist the Indian farmers in making an informed decision about which crop to grow, Our system will recommend the best suitable crop for particular land based on content and weather parameters. Hence by utilizing our system farmers can cultivate a new variety of crop, may increase in profit margin.

The main objective of this is to develop a system which predicts the crop to farmers which gives more yield to farmers and also helps in the growth of the economy of our country . The system's goal is to recommend the crop. The "SMART AGRICULTURE SYSTEM” recommends the suitable crop for their farmland . Farmers in India should pay particular attention to farming that is precise and effective. There are several ways to raise agricultural yields in India, understand profitability, and make money. Improve the quality of the crops to maintain the agriculture sector's economic growth.

we created an 'FARMEASY' web application for farmers.The webapp provides a user-friendly interface that allows farmers to input their farm-specific data and view crop recommendations The interface is simple, intuitive, and easily accessible.

In this system we used various machine learning algorithms like DecisionTree(DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, KNN, ANN, CNN, Support Vector Machine(SVM), LSTM, BILSTM, GRU Algorithms.
